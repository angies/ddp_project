## Predicting Pressure Application. 

Overview

- It predicts vapor pressure values of mercury from given temperature values.
- The bs function of the spline package has been implemented.
- A range of degrees of freedom from 3 to 10 have been used. 
- Adjusted R Squared is estimated, which is a metric for evaluating the goodness of fit of the model.
- The supplied data are from pressure dataset package. 
- You can choose scatter and line style plot.

## Predicing Pressure View.

You can run Predicting Pressure App in <https://ae2015.shinyapps.io/predict_pressure/>.

When you change the degrees of freedom, the App estimates and plots the new predicted pressure values.
